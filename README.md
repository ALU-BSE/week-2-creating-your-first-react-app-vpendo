### Guided Learning Activity: Creating Your First React App with TypeScript and Vite

**Goal:** Build a simple React app that displays a heading and a paragraph of text using a custom component, styled with CSS.

**Prerequisites:**

  * **Node.js and npm:** Ensure you have Node.js (version 16 or later recommended) and npm installed. You can verify this by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.
  * **Code Editor:** A code editor like VS Code, Atom, or Sublime Text is recommended.
  * **Basic Terminal/Command Line Knowledge:** Familiarity with navigating your file system and running commands in the terminal.
  * **Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript:** You will learn concepts as you go, but basic understanding is helpful.

**Steps:**

**Step 1: Set up the Project with Vite**

1.  **Open your terminal/command prompt.**

2.  **Create the project:**

    ```bash
    npm create vite@latest my-first-react-app -- --template react-ts
    ```

      * `npm create vite@latest`: This command uses npm to run the latest version of Vite's project initializer.
      * `my-first-react-app`: This is the name of your project. You can choose any name you like.
      * `-- --template react-ts`: This tells Vite to use the React template with TypeScript support.

3.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd my-first-react-app
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

    This command installs all the necessary packages (React, ReactDOM, etc.) that are listed in the `package.json` file.

5.  **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command starts the Vite development server. You should see a message in the terminal indicating the server is running, usually on `http://localhost:5173/`.

6.  **Open your web browser and visit** `http://localhost:5173/`. You should see the default Vite + React starter page.

**Step 2: Understand the Project Structure**

Let's take a quick look at the important files and folders generated by Vite:

  * **`index.html`:** The main HTML file where your React app will be injected.
  * **`src/`:** The directory where you'll write your React application code.
      * **`main.tsx`:** The entry point of your React application. It renders the root component (`App`) into the HTML.
      * **`App.tsx`:** The main component of your application. We will be creating a new component soon.
      * **`App.css`:** CSS styles specifically for the `App` component.
      * **`vite-env.d.ts`:** This file ensures TypeScript understands Vite's environment variables.
  * **`package.json`:** Lists your project's dependencies and scripts.
  * **`tsconfig.json`:** Configuration file for the TypeScript compiler.
  * **`vite.config.ts`:** Configuration file for Vite.

**Step 3: Create Your First Component**

1.  **Create a new file:** Inside the `src` directory, create a new file named `MyComponent.tsx`.

2.  **Add the component code:**

    ```typescript
    import React from 'react';

    const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
      return (
        <div>
          <h1>Hello from MyComponent!</h1>
          <p>This is a paragraph of text within my component.</p>
        </div>
      );
    };

    export default MyComponent;
    ```

      * `import React from 'react'`: Imports the necessary React library.
      * `const MyComponent: React.FC = () => { ... }`: Defines a functional component named `MyComponent`. `React.FC` specifies that it's a functional component type.
      * `return ( ... )`: The JSX code that defines what this component renders. JSX is an extension to JavaScript that lets you write HTML-like code within your JavaScript/TypeScript files.
      * `export default MyComponent`: Makes the component available for use in other parts of your application.

**Step 4: Use Your Component in `App.tsx`**

1.  **Open `src/App.tsx`**.
2.  **Modify the content:** Remove the current content of `App.tsx` and replace it with the following code:
    ```typescript
    import React from 'react';
    import MyComponent from './MyComponent';
    import './App.css';

    function App() {
      return (
        <div className="App">
          <MyComponent />
        </div>
      );
    }

    export default App;
    ```
      * `import MyComponent from './MyComponent'`: Imports your newly created component.
      * `<MyComponent />`: Uses the `MyComponent` within the `App` component's JSX.

**Step 5: Style Your Component**

1.  **Create a CSS file for your component:** Inside the `src` directory, create a new file named `MyComponent.css`.

2.  **Add CSS styles:**

    ```css
    .my-component {
      background-color: lightblue;
      padding: 20px;
      border: 1px solid blue;
      border-radius: 5px;
      text-align: center;
    }

    .my-component h1 {
      color: navy;
    }

    .my-component p {
      font-size: 16px;
    }
    ```

3.  **Import the CSS file in `MyComponent.tsx`:**

    ```typescript
    import React from 'react';
    import './MyComponent.css'; // Import the CSS file

    const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
      return (
        <div className="my-component">
          <h1>Hello from MyComponent!</h1>
          <p>This is a paragraph of text within my component.</p>
        </div>
      );
    };

    export default MyComponent;
    ```

      * `import './MyComponent.css'` is added to import the CSS file.
      * `className="my-component"` is added to the `div` element so that the styles are applied.

4.  **Optional: Style the `App` component:** You can also add some styles to the `App` component in `App.css` (e.g., to center the content):

    ```css
    .App {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
      min-height: 100vh;
    }
    ```

**Step 6: Run and View**

1.  If your development server stopped, run `npm run dev` again in the terminal.
2.  Refresh (or open) `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser.

You should now see your styled component with the heading and paragraph displayed. You can add your own changes to the code and the browser will automatically refresh and display the changes.

**Congratulations\!** You have created your first React app with TypeScript and Vite, created a custom component, displayed content, and applied basic styling.

  * **Props:** Learn how to pass data into components using props.
  * **State:** Explore how to manage dynamic data within your components using state.
  * **More Complex Styling:** Look into styled-components or other CSS-in-JS solutions for more advanced styling techniques.

  * **React Documentation:** The official React documentation is an excellent resource: [https://react.dev/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://react.dev/)
  * **TypeScript Documentation:** Learn more about TypeScript and its features: [https://www.typescriptlang.org/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&source=gmail&q=https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
